Whats it about:
===============

Finding funny pictures on the interwebz is easy, sharing them in a appropiate way is hard.

The goal of this project is to offer an easy way to share an image on Social Networks

* without hosting it by yourself
* without uploading it to another provider
* without uploading it to your profile
* without ANY kind of storage (i.e. database)

Relase Notes
============

0.0.1alpha:

* From now on we are in 0.0.1 alpha stage, maybe a negative Version would be more appropiate, because there is noc code in it yet... :)
